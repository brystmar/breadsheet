Suppose you're invited to a picnic on Saturday afternoon.  Captivated by your exemplary breadmaking skills over the years, the group asks you to bake a fresh loaf of sourdough.

There are many time-sensitive steps in this process, with a fair bit of downtime between steps.  Depending how your _levain_ is stored, you may need to start as early as Thursday!

But wait, this is `${DateJoke().getFullYear()}`, and you've got a busy schedule.  Use [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.com) to calculate the start & finish times for each step and the overall recipe.  

Save your brainwaves for the important things in life.  Leave the scheduling to [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.com).
