Baking enthusiasts know how tricky scheduling can be, especially for longer recipes.  This [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.appspot.com) tool simplifies the process, helping you solve for start & finish times of each step and the overall recipe.

Suppose you're invited to a potluck brunch on Saturday and plan to bring a fresh loaf of sourdough.  This process has many steps -- most of which are time-sensitve -- and there's a fair bit of downtime between steps.

Here's an example using a classic sourdough recipe from [Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/):
* Wake up the sourdough starter by feeding it Thursday evening
* Feed it again Friday morning
* Mix the dough Friday afternoon
* Fold it a few times during the first hour
* Divide & shape the loaves
* Let them proof in the fridge overnight
* Bake on Saturday morning

Leave the scheduling to [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.appspot.com).  You focus on baking.
