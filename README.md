Baking enthusiasts know how tricky scheduling can be, especially for longer recipes.  This [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.appspot.com) tool simplifies the process, helping you solve for start & finish times for each step and for the overall recipe.

Suppose you're invited to a potluck brunch on Saturday and plan to bring a fresh loaf of sourdough.  This process has many steps -- most of which are time-sensitve -- with a fair bit of downtime between steps.  If your starter is resting in the fridge, you'll need to start the process on Thursday!  

Use your brainwaves on the important things in life.  Leave the scheduling to [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.appspot.com).
