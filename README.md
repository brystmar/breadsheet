Baking enthusiasts know how tricky scheduling can be, especially for longer recipes.  [Breadsheet](http://breadsheet.appspot.com) simplifies the process, helping you solve for start & finish times for each step and for the overall recipe.

Suppose you want a freshly-baked sourdough loaf ready for lunch on Saturday.  There are many time-sensitive steps in this process, with a fair bit of downtime between steps.  Depending how your _levain_ is stored, you may need to start as early as Thursday!
