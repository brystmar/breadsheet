Anyone who loves to bake knows scheduling is tricky, especially for longer recipes.  The [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.appspot.com) simplifies this process, helping you solve for start & finish times of steps and the overall recipe.

Suppose you're invited to a potluck brunch on Saturday and plan to bring a fresh loaf of sourdough.  There's many steps to this process, and although each is fairly time-sensitve, there's a fair bit of downtime between steps.

Here's an example using my go-to sourdough recipe from [Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/):
* Wake up the sourdough starter by feeding it Thursday evening
* Feed it again Friday morning
* Mix the dough Friday afternoon
* Fold it a few times during the first hour
* Divide & shape the loaves
* Let them proof in the fridge overnight
* Bake on Saturday morning

Leave the scheduling to [breadsheet](http://breadsheet.appspot.com).  You focus on baking.
