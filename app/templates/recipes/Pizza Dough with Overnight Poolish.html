        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line">1. <strong><strong>Mix the poolish:</strong></strong> The  evening before you plan to bake your pizza, mix 500g flour and 0.4 gram (a scant ⅛ tsp) of yeast by hand in a 6-quart tub.  Add 500g of water at 80°F (27°C) and mix by hand just until incorporated.  Cover and leave out overnight at room temperature.  The following timeline assumes overnight room temperature is 65-70°F (18-21°C).</p><p class="line">When fully mature <span class='timer' time='43200.0'>12 to 14 hours </span>later, the poolish should be about tripled in volume (it comes just below the 2-quart line on my 6-quart Cambro tub), with bubbles popping on the surface at least every few seconds.  Poolish will stay at this peak level of maturity for about <span class='timer' time='7200.0'>2 hours</span>, unless your room temperature is warm - say, above 76°F (24°C) - in which case it will be at its peak for only about <span class='timer' time='3600.0'>1 hour</span>.  At this point you can mix the final dough.</p><p class="line">2. <strong><strong>Mix the final dough:</strong></strong> Measure 500g of flour into a 12-quart round tub, then add the 20g salt and mix by hand.</p><p class="line">Pour 250g of 105°F (41°C) water around the perimeter of the poolish, loosening it from its tub.  Then pour the water and poolish into the flour mixture in the 12-quart tub.</p><p class="line">Mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn&apos;t stick to you. (It&apos;s fine to re-wet your hand three or four times while you mix.)  Use the pincer method (page 67) alternating with folding the dough to fully integrate the ingredients.  The target dough temperature at the end of the mix is 75°F (24°C).</p><p class="line">3. <strong><strong>Fold:</strong></strong> This  dough needs two folds (see pages 69-70 for instructions).  It&apos;s best to apply the folds during the first hour after mixing the dough.  After the second fold, lightly coat the dough and the bottom of the tub with olive oil to help prevent sticking.</p><p class="line">When the dough is about 2½ times its original volume, about <span class='timer' time='21600.0'>6 hours </span>after mixing, it&apos;s ready to be divided.</p><p class="line">4. <strong><strong>Divide:</strong></strong> Moderately  flour a work surface about 2 feet wide.  With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the tub.  With your hands still floured, pick up the dough and ease it back down onto the work surface in a somewhat even shape.  Dust the entire top of the dough with flour, then cut it into 5 equal-size pieces with a dough knife or plastic dough scraper.  Each piece should weigh about 350g. (If you plan to use any of the dough for thin-crust pizza or focaccia, divide that portion of the dough into 200g pieces.)</p><p class="line">5. <strong><strong>Shape the dough into balls:</strong></strong> Shape  each piece of dough into a medium-tight round following the instructions on pages 71-73, working gently and being careful not to degas the dough.</p><p class="line">6. <strong><strong>Refrigerate:</strong></strong> Put  the dough balls on a lightly floured baking sheet, leaving space between them to allow for expansion.  Lightly oil or flour the tops, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for <span class='timer' time='1800.0'>30 to 60 minutes</span>.  Refrigerate for at least <span class='timer' time='1800.0'>30 minutes </span>to make the dough easier to shape.</p><p class="line">See chapter 14 for instructions for shaping, topping, and baking pizzas.  Stored in the refrigerator and tightly covered, any leftover dough will keep for up to 2 days.  You may prefer the next-day dough as it develops flavors with more time in the refrigerator.</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">Notes</h3>
        <div itemprop="comment" class="notes text">
            <p>Yields five 350g dough balls, each of which yields a ~12&quot; thin-crust, pizza-stone pizza; or a smaller, thick-crust iron-skillet pizza.  If using this dough for focaccia, the dough balls should be 200g each for thin &amp; crispy focaccia, or 350g each for chewier focaccia.  See page 215 for details on amounts of dough for different applications.</p><p>POOLISH FERMENTATION: 12 to 14 hours<br/>BULK FERMENTATION: About 6 hours<br/>PROOF TIME: At least 1½ hours<br/>SAMPLE SCHEDULE: Mix the poolish at 8pm, mix the final dough at 10am the next morning, shape into dough balls at 4pm, and make pizza that evening.</p><p>This dough has two things going for it: a particular flavor provided by the fermentation of the poolish, and a crisp, poofy-rimmed, delicate crust that has a light texture and open holes.  The dough is leavened entirely with the poolish, which incorporates 50% of the total amount of flour in the dough.</p><p>This dough also has higher hydration than the other pizza dough recipes in the book, using 75% water relative to the weight of the flour.  This produces a softer dough that requires two folds, preferably during the first hour of fermentation to give it more strength and tenacity.  You need to take extra care when shaping pizzas from this soft dough.  Although I&apos;ve learned to toss and twirl this dough it does break and tear more easily, so the recommended shaping method for this dough is to use balled-up fists to stretch it into shape (without tossing it), as described on page 211.</p><p>Because the dough isn&apos;t as strong, it&apos;s also important not to load the pizzas down with too much weight from sauce or toppings.  A pizza that breaks when you load it into the oven isn&apos;t fun to deal with.  Another option is to make this dough at a hydration closer to 70%.  To do so, simply reduce the amount of water in the final dough mix by 40g or 50g.</p><p>You might think of this as an advanced recipe to try once you&apos;re confident with the other pizza doughs in this book.  A successful pizza made from this dough is well worth the effort, in taste and texture.  It&apos;s also a good example of how dough can be leavened solely with a poolish and no added yeast.  I love the fact that just 0.4 gram of yeast — a scant ⅛ tsp — can leaven a batch of dough that makes five pizzas.</p>
