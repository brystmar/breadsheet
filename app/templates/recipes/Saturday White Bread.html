    <!-- Directions -->
    
    <div class="directionsbox">
        <h3 class="subhead">Directions</h3>
        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line">1. <strong><strong>Autolyse:</strong></strong> Combine  the 1000 g of flour with the 720g of 90°F to 95°F (32°C to 35°C) water in a 12-quart round tub or similar container.  Mix by hand just until incorporated.  Cover and let rest for <span class='timer' time='1200.0'>20 to 30 minutes</span>.</p><p class="line">2. <strong><strong>Mix:</strong></strong> Sprinkle  the 21g of salt and the 4g (1 level tsp) of yeast evenly over the top of the dough.  Mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn&apos;t stick to you. (It&apos;s fine to rewet your hand three or four times while you mix.) Reach underneath the dough and grab about one-quarter of it.  Gently stretch this section of dough and fold it over the top to the other side of the dough.  Repeat three more times with the remaining dough, until the salt and yeast are fully enclosed.</p><p class="line">Use the pincer method to fully integrate the ingredients.  Make five or six pincer cuts across the entire mass of dough.  Then fold the dough over itself a few times.  Repeat, alternately cutting and folding until all of the ingredients are full integrated and the dough has some tension in it.   Let the dough rest for a few minutes, then fold for another <span class='timer' time='30.0'>30 seconds </span>or until the dough tightens up, The whole process should take about <span class='timer' time='300.0'>5 minutes</span>.  The target dough temperature at the end of the mix is 77°F to 78°F (25°C to 26°C).  Cover the tub and let the dough rise.</p><p class="line">3. <strong><strong>Fold:</strong></strong> This  dough needs two folds (see pages 69-70 for instructions).  It&apos;s easiest to apply the folds during the first <span class='timer' time='5400.0'>1½ hours </span>after mixing the dough.  Apply the first fold about <span class='timer' time='600.0'>10 minutes </span>after mixing and the second fold during the next hour (when you see the dough spread out in the tub, it&apos;s ready for the second fold).  If needed, it&apos;s okay to fold later, just be sure to leave it alone for the last hour of rising.</p><p class="line">When the dough is triple its original volume, about <span class='timer' time='18000.0'>5 hours </span>after mixing, it&apos;s ready to be divided.</p><p class="line">4. <strong><strong>Divide:</strong></strong> Moderately  flour a work surface about 2 feet wide.  Flour your hands and sprinkle a bit of flour around the edges of the tub.  Tip the tub slightly and gently work your floured free hand beneath the dough to loosen it from the bottom of the tub.  Gently ease the dough out onto the work surface without pulling or tearing it.  With floured hands, pick up the dough and ease it back down onto the work surface in 8 somewhat even shape.  Dust the area in the middle, where you&apos;ll cut the dough, with 8 bit of flour.  Cut the dough into 2 equal-size pieces with a dough knife or plastic dough scraper.</p><p class="line">5. <strong><strong>Shape:</strong></strong> Dust 2 proofing baskets with flour.  Shape each piece of dough into a medium-tight ball, following the instructions on pages 71-73.  Place each seam side down in its proofing basket.</p><p class="line">6. <strong><strong>Proof:</strong></strong> Lightly  flour the tops of the loaves.  Set them side by side and cover with a kitchen towel, or place each basket in a non-perforated plastic bag.  Plan on baking the loaves about <span class='timer' time='5400.0'>1½ hours </span>after they are shaped, assuming a room temperature of about 70°F (21°C).  If your kitchen is warmer, they will be optimally proofed in about <span class='timer' time='3600.0'>1 hour</span>.  Use the finger-dent test (see page 74) to determine when they are perfectly proofed and ready to bake, being sure to check the loaves after <span class='timer' time='3600.0'>1 hour</span>.  With this bread, <span class='timer' time='900.0'>15 minutes </span>can make the difference between being perfectly proofed and collapsing a bit.</p><p class="line">7. <strong><strong>Preheat:</strong></strong> At  least <span class='timer' time='2700.0'>45 minutes </span>prior to baking, put a rack in the middle of the oven and put 2 Dutch ovens on the rack with their lids on.  Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).  If you only have 1 Dutch oven, put the second loaf into the refrigerator about <span class='timer' time='1200.0'>20 minutes </span>before baking the first loaf and bake the loaves sequentially, giving the Dutch oven a <span class='timer' time='300.0'>5-minute </span>reheat after removing the first loaf.  Alternatively, you can keep the second loaf in the refrigerator overnight, in its proofing basket inside a non-perforated plastic bag, and bake it early the next morning; if you do this, put the second loaf in the refrigerator immediately after shaping.</p><p class="line">8. <strong><strong>Bake:</strong></strong> Invert  the proofed loaf onto a lightly floured countertop, keeping in mind that the top of the loaf will be the side that was facing down while it was rising-the seam side.  Use oven mitts to remove the preheated Dutch oven from the oven.  Remove the lid.  Carefully place the loaf in the hot Dutch oven seam side up.  Use mitts to replace the lid, then put the Dutch oven in the oven.  Maintain the temperature at 475°F (245°C).</p><p class="line">Bake for <span class='timer' time='1800.0'>30 minutes</span>, then carefully remove the lid and bake for about 20 more minutes, until at least medium dark brown all around the loaf Check after <span class='timer' time='900.0'>15 minutes </span>of baking uncovered in case your oven runs hot.  Remove the Dutch oven and carefully tilt it to turn the loaf out.  Let cool on a rack or set the loaf on its side so air can circulate around it.  Let the loaf rest for at least <span class='timer' time='1200.0'>20 minutes </span>before slicing.</p>

            <p>Can be used as dough for pizza or focaccia.</p><p>This recipe is designed for someone who wants to make good, crusty loaves of white bread from start to finish in one day.  Mix the dough first thing in the morning, shape it into two loaves about five hours later, and then bake in the late afternoon in time for dinner.  It&apos;s also a good first recipe to try from this book to help you get familiar with my dough handling techniques, which are the same for all the recipes in this book.  Here, you get the taste benefits of a medium-length fermentation, resulting in a versatile, delicious bread that&apos;s great as a dinner bread and also works well for sandwiches and toast.</p><p>Sometimes I like to make this bread with 10% whole wheat flour for the round, earthy flavors it adds.  If you want to do that, simply make this recipe with 900 g of white Hour and 100 g of whole wheat flour.</p><p>You can bake one or two loaves from this recipe.  If you bake just one loaf, you can divide the remaining dough into two or three dough balls to make iron-skillet focaccia or pizza; refrigerate the dough balls and use them any time during the next two or three days.</p><p>I love focaccia with olive oil, salt, pepper, and maybe a sprinkling of herbs, cut into small pieces to share with friends before dinner, or just for snacks.  (See chapter 14 for specific focaccia and pizza recipes, and page 215 for pointers on using bread doughs for focaccia.)</p>
