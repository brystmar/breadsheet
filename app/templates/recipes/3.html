        <h3 class="subhead">Directions</h3>
        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line"><strong>Choose your method:</strong></p><p class="line">1a. <strong><strong>Food Processor:</strong></strong> Combine  flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine.  Add water, then turn on processor and process until dough forms a ball that rides around the bowl of the processor, about <span class='timer' time='30.0'>30 seconds</span>.  Continue processing for <span class='timer' time='30.0'>30 seconds </span>longer.  Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about <span class='timer' time='7200.0'>2 hours</span>.</p><p class="line">1b. <strong><strong>Stand Mixer:</strong></strong> Combine  flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment.  Stir to combine, then add water.  Mix on low speed until dough comes together into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for <span class='timer' time='600.0'>10 minutes</span>.  Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky ball, about <span class='timer' time='600.0'>10 minutes </span>longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads rather than riding around the edges.) Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about <span class='timer' time='7200.0'>2 hours</span>.</p><p class="line">1c. <strong><strong>By Hand:</strong></strong> Combine  flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl.  Whisk to combine, then add water and stir with a wooden spoon until a rough ball of dough has formed.  Set aside for <span class='timer' time='600.0'>10 minutes</span>.  Turn dough out onto a countertop and knead until a smooth, silky ball has formed, about <span class='timer' time='600.0'>10 minutes</span>.  Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about <span class='timer' time='7200.0'>2 hours</span>.</p><p class="line">2. <strong><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong></strong> Pour  a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan.  Transfer dough to pan and turn to coat in oil.  Press down on dough and spread it toward the edges.  You won&apos;t be able to get it all the way to the edges yet; that&apos;s okay.  Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then cover tightly in plastic and set aside for <span class='timer' time='1800.0'>30 minutes </span>to allow dough to relax.</p><p class="line">Return to dough and stretch it out again.  It should be able to reach the edges this time.  If not, let it rest a little more and try again.  To get the dough to stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into place.  Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make the sauce.</p><p class="line">3. <strong><strong>Preheat:</strong></strong> Adjust  oven rack to lowest position, place your pizza steel (or stone) on the rack, and preheat the oven as hot as it goes, ideally at least 550°F (290°C).  Preheat for at least <span class='timer' time='1800.0'>30 minutes</span>.</p><p class="line">4. <strong><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over <strong>medium heat</strong> until  shimmering.  Add minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about <span class='timer' time='30.0'>30 seconds</span>.  Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar.  Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 3 cups, about <span class='timer' time='1800.0'>30 minutes</span>.  Season to taste with salt.</p><p class="line">5. <strong><strong>Build the Pizza:</strong></strong> Press  down on dough with your fingertips to remove any large air bubbles.  Reserve ~20% of the pepperoni for the very end.</p><p class="line">Lay half of the remaining pepperoni evenly over face of dough.  Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very edges of the pan, then add the other half of pepperoni.  Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You will need only about half the sauce - save the rest for another pizza.)</p><p class="line">Take the reserved pepperoni and fold each in half.  Wedge them, seam-side down, around the edges of the pizza between the side of the pan and the dough.  These crisp up nicely and are the best part of the pizza!</p><p class="line">6. <strong><strong>Bake:</strong></strong> Transfer  to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese on top is starting to lightly brown, <span class='timer' time='720.0'>12 to 15 minutes</span>.  Transfer to a trivet or folded kitchen towel on countertop.</p><p class="line">7.  Run a thin metal spatula all the way around the edges of the pan to loosen the pizza.  Carefully lift it out and slide it onto a cutting board.  Cut pizza and serve immediately.</p><p class="line">Reheat any leftovers in the toaster oven.  Use a moderate temperature so the slices don&apos;t burn before being heated through.</p>

Cook time: 15 minutes.</p><p>Use a high-quality, natural-casing pepperoni such as Boar&apos;s Head or Vermont Smoke &amp; Cure.</p><p>Brick cheese is a high-fat aged cheese from Wisconsin.  It has a buttery flavor and browns very well, giving Detroit pizza its distinct flavor.  If you can&apos;t get your hands on Brick cheese, use a combination of Jack or young cheddar and low-moisture mozzarella.</p><p>Brick cheese: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HYMXJO6/<br/>Boar’s Head pepperoni: https://www.amazon.com/Boars-Head-Whole-Pepperoni/dp/B00KOVU29O/<br/>Vermont Smoke &amp; Cure: https://www.amazon.com/Vermont-Smoke-Cure-Pepperoni-Uncured/dp/B01HEHVKKU/</p><p>For best results, use a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan.
